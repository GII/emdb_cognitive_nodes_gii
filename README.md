# e-MDB reference implementation for cognitive nodes

This repository contains the packages that implement the reference cognitive nodes of the software implementation of the e-MDB cognitive architecture developed under the [PILLAR Robots project](https://pillar-robots.eu/).
It includes implementations for Perceptions, P-Nodes, Goals, World Models, Utility Models, C-Nodes, Needs, Drives, and Policies, although some of them are barebones at the moment.

There are two ROS 2 packages in this repository:

- **cognitive_nodes:** Implementations of the cognitive nodes.
- **cognitive_nodes_interfaces:** Services and messages definitions.

You can find information and tutorials about this repository and the others that are part of the e-MDB cognitive architecture software in the [PILLAR Robots official documentation](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/en/latest/)
