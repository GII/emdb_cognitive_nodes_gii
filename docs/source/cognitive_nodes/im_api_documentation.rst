Intrinsic Motivations
=====================

Here you can find a description of all the scripts that implement the different intrinsic motivation components,
which drive autonomous exploration and learning in the cognitive architecture.

++++++++++
Novelty
++++++++++

Python script which implements components for exploration intrinsic motivation, based on novelty, which enables
robots to explore their environment.

For the moment, only a random exploration is implemented.

+++++++++++++++
LLM Exploration
+++++++++++++++

Python script which implements components for exploration intrinsic motivation, guided by a Large Language Model (LLM),
which enables robots to explore their environment with the help of an LLM.

+++++++++++++++
Effectance
+++++++++++++++

Python script which implements components for effectance intrinsic motivation, based on detecting and reproducing effects, which enables
robots to learn from the consequences of their actions in the environment.

This module includes both internal effectance (detecting P-Node consolidation) and external effectance (detecting and reproducing changes 
in sensor values).

+++++++++++++++
Prospection
+++++++++++++++

Python script which implements components for prospection intrinsic motivation, focused on discovering hierarchical 
relationships between goals in the system. This enables robots to build knowledge chains by identifying when achieving 
one goal can lead to another.
